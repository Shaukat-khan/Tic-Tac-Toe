# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project allows a person and a cpu to play a game of tic-tac-toe with each other until one of them wins or it is a tie. 
## Steps
A 2d array was created so that the board can be built for us to play the game. We create the rows and columns so that there can be 6 places for X or O's until we get 3 cross so one person can win. Then we ask the user to enter their placement by picking a number from 1-9 in the board using scanner. Once the user has gone, the cpu will have its turn. We make sure that cpu does not take the position that we chose on the board and rather choose an empty spot. The cpu chooses a position by using random. We loop the whole process so that we end up with either the player or cpu winning or end up being a tie.
